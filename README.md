### Description

This packages adds new model classes designed to emulate stand Django models, but that can use Elasticsearch as a backend, as opposed to a traditional RDB. It borrows architectural patterns from [ElasticSearch-DSL](https://github.com/elastic/elasticsearch-dsl-py) and [Django](https://github.com/django/django)
