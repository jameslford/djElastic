- look into using ES SQL. Possibly 2 types of managers / queries: DSL and SQL. Also, could potentially use existing managers with unmanaged model and just take the SQL from the query
- setup fields for being able to save filters / aggregations
- set up fields to allow foreign keys from regular django models to the EsModel
